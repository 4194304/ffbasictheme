# ffbasictheme
This theme provides a near native look when used with the basic (non DWM) titlebars.

This is NOT a theme that should be used with the normal DWM titlebars, and instead should be used with DWM disabled or with a program that makes the basic frames render such as BasicThemer2. This theme only works as intended at 100% scale, but I'm currently in the process of adding support for 125% scale (titlebar buttons are blurry, restore button disappears).

## Install
To install this, open about:support, open the profile folder, and copy the chrome folder into the profile folder.

If the theme doesn't apply, go to about:config and set toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets to true.
