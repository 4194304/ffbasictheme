# ffbasictheme
This theme provides a near native look when used with the basic (non DWM) titlebars.

This is NOT a theme that should be used with native titlebars, and should only be used with a program that applies the basic theme to windows like BasicThemer2. This theme should also work if DWM is disabled.

## Install
To install this, open about:support, open the profile folder, and copy over the chrome folder.

If the theme doesn't apply, go to about:config and set toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets to true.
