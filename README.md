# ffbasictheme
This theme provides a near native look when used with the basic (non DWM) titlebars.

This is NOT a theme that should be used with native titlebars, and should only be used with a program that applies the basic theme to windows like BasicThemer2. This theme should also work if DWM is disabled. This theme also should not be used if the DPI scale is set to anything besides 100%.

## Install
To install this, open about:support, open the profile folder, and copy over the chrome folder. In addition, also go into about:config, enable browser.compactmode.show, and enable compact mode in the toolbar settings.

If the theme doesn't apply, go to about:config and set toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets to true.
